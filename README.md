# CNN Image Classifier (CIFAR-10)

A minimal convolutional neural network trained on **CIFAR-10**, built and deployed using **TensorFlow** and **Streamlit**.

---

## Features
- Upload your own image and get predictions instantly
- Trained on 10 classes from CIFAR-10 dataset
- Fast, lightweight, and clean UI

---

## Why Pooling?

Pooling is used to:
- Reduce computation by shrinking feature maps
- Prevent overfitting
- Retain key features while discarding noise

It helps the network generalize better and learn efficiently.
